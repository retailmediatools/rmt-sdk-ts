# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the [README](README.md) for build and test instructions
- Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!

## Pull Request Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Description must be factual (the "what?") and should provide root cause suggestions (the "why?"), for faster resolution.
- See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Reporting a security vulnerability

Due to their public nature, GitHub and mailing lists are not appropriate places for reporting vulnerabilities.
If you suspect you have found a security vulnerability, please do not file a GitHub issue, but instead email security@retailmediatools.com with the full details, including steps to reproduce the issue.

### Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually main).
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
- Submit a Pull Request, following the [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines), to the original repository.

Thanks for your contributions!
